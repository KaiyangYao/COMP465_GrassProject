#  **Grass Real-Time Rendering with Wind**
Author: Kaiyang Yao, Shengyuan Wang


### **Introduction**:
In this project, we create a realistic and visually appealing simulation of grass using OpenGL, which have a variety of potential application both in video games and virtual reality experiences. It involve the use of billboarding method, grass simulation, and wind simulation to create a realistic and dynamic grass landscape.

### **Requirements**:
To run this project, you need the following:
- C++ compiler
- OpengGL library
- GLFW library
- GLM library

### **Installation**:
To install and run the project, you should following these steps:
```
cd <yourCodeDirectory>
git clone https://github.com/KaiyangYao/COMP465_GrassProject.git
cd COMP465_GrassProject
mkdir build
cd build
cmake-gui ..
```

### **Usage**

Once you have installed and run the project, you can use the following controls:
- WASD keys to move the camera
- Mouse to look around
